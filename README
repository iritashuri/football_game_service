## Installation & Startup:
- npm install
- node app.js


## REST API specifications:
 
- get matches by team
i.e http://localhost:3000/team?team=Manchester United

- get matches by team filtered by status
i.e. http://localhost:3000/team?team=Manchester United&status=played

- get matches by tournament
i.e. http://localhost:3000/tournament?tournament=fa

- get matches by tournament filtered by status
i.e. http://localhost:3000/tournament?tournament=fa&status=upcoming


## Assumption:
The data will be loaded on startup to the RAM, meaning that it wont be accessible during runtime.
The computer running the service should be with enough RAM to handle the CSV input.
I decided to store the data in a way I will be able to get every required query to the data with O(1).
